          The Extreme Power Drive 2 lbs. Hammer is a dead blow hammer engineered to perform better than rubber or plastic face hammers. Using Naples patented Smart Hammer technology, the shot-loaded composite interior cavity is fully encased in a tough polymer outer jacket. The 100 percent cast polyurethane face is abrasion and impact-resistant. It is designed to withstand the most severe striking applications and is surface protective. Power drive handles are solid fiberglass, made through a pultrusion process that uses thousands of fiberglass strands and a unique resin making them super strong and resistant to weather, chemicals and insects (unlike most wooden handles). The hammer has an ergonomic non-slip grip designed to allow usage in slippery conditions and even with gloved hands. It delivers more power, less rebound and vibration shock reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The extreme power drive hammer is the strongest, safest tool in the industry and ideal for year round use.

          Black Jack® All-Weather Roof Cement is a pliable asphalt roof cement that can be used on damp as well as dry surfaces. All-Weather Cement is ideal for many roof repairs and for stopping roof leaks around vent pipes, spouts, valleys, skylights, gutters and chimneys. Use for the construction and repair of flashings, but not on rubber membranes or EPDM roofing systems. It may also be used to seal cracks in exterior chimneys, walls, foundation joints and for lining leaking gutters and troughs.
